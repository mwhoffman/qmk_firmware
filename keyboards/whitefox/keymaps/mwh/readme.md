# mwh Layout for Whitefox Vanilla

This is a layout for the Whitefox vanilla layout. The first layer is mostly
standard with the Escape key also acting as Grave when Shift/GUI are active and
Capslock replaced by Ctrl when held and Escape when tapped. Fn activates a media
layer (also including F1-12 and home/end keys) and Fn+Alt activates a "special"
layer mostly for flashing the board (under Fn+Alt+f).

The visualizer has also been updated so that the backlight fades in on startup
(if it's on) and otherwise does nothing.

See the keymap file for more details.
