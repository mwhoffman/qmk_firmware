# mwh Layout for Massdrop CTRL

This is a layout for the Massdrop CTRL. The first layer is mostly standard with
Capslock replaced by Ctrl when held and Escape when tapped. Fn activates a media
layer and Fn+Alt activates a "special" layer mostly for flashing the board
(under Fn+Alt+f).

The RGB matrix code has also been updated to start off and to disable a few of
the more active animations.

See the keymap file for more details.
